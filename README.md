# Deep Learning and Embodied Intelligence Models

This repository contains my personal exploration and implementation of classic deep learning models as well as modern robotics-oriented embodied intelligence models. The work is divided into several components, focusing on both traditional classification networks and emerging robotics frameworks.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Classic Classification Networks
Located in `the learn of torch and model/classifaction_net`, this section includes the implementation of widely used classification networks such as:

- **GoogleNet**
- **ResNet**
- **MobileNet**

These implementations are aimed at understanding the fundamental architectures and mechanisms that have driven progress in image classification tasks.

### 2. Robotics-Oriented Models
In addition to classification networks, I have explored modern robotics-oriented networks. Notably, this includes an initial reproduction of **Diffusion Policy**, a cutting-edge model for robotics applications. This effort reflects my interest in bridging deep learning with embodied intelligence for robotic systems.

## Purpose of the Repository
This repository serves as a learning ground for both:

1. Understanding and implementing foundational deep learning models.
2. Exploring and reproducing modern models used in robotics and embodied intelligence.

## Future Directions
- Expanding the range of classification networks to include newer architectures.
- Deepening my understanding of robotics models and their applications.
- Experimenting with hybrid approaches that integrate classic deep learning models with embodied intelligence frameworks.

I hope this repository proves helpful for anyone interested in learning about both classic and modern neural networks, particularly those at the intersection of deep learning and robotics.
