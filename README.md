# Deep Learning and Embodied Intelligence Models

This repository contains my personal exploration and implementation of classic deep learning models as well as some embodied intelligence models. 

## Repository Structure

### 1. Classic Classification Networks
Located in `the learn of torch and model/classifaction_net`, this section includes the implementation of widely used classification networks such as:

- **GoogleNet**
- **ResNet**
- **MobileNet**

These implementations are aimed at understanding the fundamental architectures and mechanisms that have driven progress in image classification tasks.

### 2. Robot Learning Models
In addition to classification networks, I have explored modern robot learning networks. So far,I only study and initial implemente the**diffusion policy**model.Future work includes studying **ACT**,**RT** and so on

## Purpose of the Repository
This repository serves as a learning ground for both:

1. Understanding and implementing foundational deep learning models.
2. Exploring and reproducing modern models used in robotics and embodied intelligence.

I hope this repository proves helpful for anyone interested in learning about both classic and modern neural networks, particularly those at the intersection of deep learning and robotics.
